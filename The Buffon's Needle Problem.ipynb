This means that we can estimate $P$ by performing the experiment and dropping needles on a page to count what fraction of them intersect with a line, and then use that estimate to calculate $\\pi$ from the equation $\\pi ≈ \\frac {2}{P}$. The more tests we run (i.e. the more needles we drop), the more accurate our estimate of $P$ will be, and by extension, our estimate of $\\pi$.
